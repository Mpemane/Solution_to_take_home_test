Solutions to hyperiondev take home test
# Section A solution Code Review Python Task.
The code, that the student submitted was grade on the following critiria
####  <br /> -Documentation = 0/4
#### <br /> -Style = 1/4
#### <br /> -Efficiency = 1/4
#### <br /> -Correctness = 1/4
Line five has running error as you have not pass any aguement
<br /> The entire block of code is not indented properly, which results in a compiling error
### Positive Aspects of the code
The student show good understanding of classes and functions, showed good implemetation of them.
### Things to improve on to make the code better. 
The student should follow the Python PEP-8 style, by adding comments, indent the code properly, spacing the code correctly to improve readability of the code. should do some test runs of the code, to avoid compiling, running and logical errors on your code.
https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/, I have added a link, That the student can use to find out more about the python PEP-8 style.
# Section B link to a project.
This project uses Machine Learning to build a RNN model which you can use to classify movie reviews as either negative or positive, which is a sentiment analysis project.

# Section C Solve the Say Number challenge, using python.
from num2words import num2words  # import the library that is needed for this task.
<br /> num = int(input("Please enter the number that you want to know how  its pronounce: ")) # Prompt the use to enter a number.
<br /> def num_to_words(num):  # defines the function.
    <br /> out_put = num2words(num)  # initiate a variable output, that outputs the numbers the way it i pronounce
    <br /> print(out_put)  # print out the output.
<br /> num_to_words(num)  # calling the function and outputing the answer.
I have included a python file, titled say number.py which has the code that solve the say number challenge.
